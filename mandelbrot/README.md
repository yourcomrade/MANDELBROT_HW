This part contains all of the code for the Mandelbrot calculation system. It uses fix-point number 27bits with 1 sign bit, 3 integer bits and 23 fractional bits. The csv file is the file generated from the Python code which contains pixel position at x-axis, y-axis, real number corresponding to x-axis, imaginary number corresponding to y-axis, and number of iteration. Both the real number and the imaginary number are fix-point number 27 bits. The real number is from -2.0 to 1.0. The imaginary number is from the -1.0 to 1.0. The output.txt file is the file generated by the testbench code from the mandelbrot_single_sys_tb.v file. It is to verify if the verilog code works by producing the right iteration number corresponding to the each pixel coordinate or not.
